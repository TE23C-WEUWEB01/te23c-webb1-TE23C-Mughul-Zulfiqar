        <p>Pierce the Veil is an American rock band formed in San Diego, California, in 2006. It was founded by brothers
            Vic and Mike Fuentes after the disbanding of Before Today, which formed out of the San Diego punk scene.
            Jaime Preciado and Tony Perry joined the group in 2007, on bass and lead guitar respectively.</p>
        <p> Pierce the Veil has released five studio albums and has toured worldwide since the release of their debut
            album, A Flair for the Dramatic in 2007. The band released their second full-length studio album, titled
            Selfish Machines in 2010. Their third album, Collide with the Sky, was released in 2012, and is their first
            album released by Fearless Records. Featuring the hit first single "King for a Day", the album debuted at
            No. 12 on the US Billboard 200. Their fourth album, Misadventures, was released on May 13, 2016, and
            following a hiatus, their fifth album, The Jaws of Life, was released on February 10, 2023.</p>
