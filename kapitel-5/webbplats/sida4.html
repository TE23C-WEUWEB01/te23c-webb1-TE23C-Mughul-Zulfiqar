        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 , June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and
            philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of
            the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his vast contributions to music, dance and fashion, along with
            his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across
            a variety of musical styles. Through his decorative singing and visual presentation, he popularized street
            dance moves such as the moonwalk, which he named, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean.</p>
        <p> As the eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers
            Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). The Jackson 5
            signed with Motown in 1968 and achieved worldwide success with Michael as lead singer. Jackson began his
            solo career in 1971 while at Motown and recorded multiple successful singles. He became a global solo star
            with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and
            "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the
            medium into an art form and promotional tool.</p>
